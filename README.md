# Instructions

Clone this repository and return your implementation as zip (or tar) with .git (we would like to see your commit history :)

Repository contains skeleton of simple Java 8 / Spring Boot based app, which is missing implementation for login functionality. Your task is to implement simple RESTful API with (unit) tests for user login. There is no single "correct" answer but the API has to fulfill the contract:

* GET /api/login?username={username}&password={password} -> 200 OK with JSON web token in response body, on correct credentials
* GET /api/login/?username={username}&password={password} -> 401 Forbidden, on invalid credentials

Architecture of the app should be flexible enough so that if needed, fetching users/checking the credentials from external database or API would be easy and doesn't require changes to existing code. For this assignment, external database is not necessary.

# Prerequisites

To develop and run the app you need:

* Java 8
* Maven 3 (https://maven.apache.org/)

# Used libraries in the skeleton

* Spring Boot (http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/)
* Java JWT (https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt)
* Mockito (http://mockito.org/)
* Hamcrest (https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/wiki/Tutorial)

Feel free to use other libs if you need/like to :)

# Run the tests

`mvn test`

# Start the container/app

`mvn spring-boot:run`

# Clean build

`mvn clean`
